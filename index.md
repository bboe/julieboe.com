Bites is the debut collection of short stores by Julie Boe

> Misfortune doesn’t knock, it kicks the door in. This mixed genre collection of micro-fiction, short stories, and prose poems peers into the gray area between where a dream ends and reality begins. Characters trespass into dangerous emotional and physical worlds, confronting loss, class divides, and the quiet collapse of moral certainty. As the world unravels around them, one question echoes: When the rules of society fall apart, what remains of humanity? In emotionally evocative bursts of narrative and lyrical reflection, the collection explores how we endure what the world offers and what it takes away.

## About

Julie Boe is captivated by the power of micro-fiction and the emotional resonance that carefully chosen words can create.  Through her writing, she aims for readers to reflect on morality and shine a light on the struggles faced by those less fortunate in society.  She has a Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing from the University of San Francisco, which she still believes to be the best city in the world.  She lives near the ocean with her husband Bryce and two young children.  When she’s not writing stories, you can find her on the pickleball courts in sunny California or wine tasting in the Santa Ynez Valley.
