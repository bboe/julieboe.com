## Bites (Release July 16, 2025)

Debut collection of short stores by Julie Boe

> Misfortune doesnâ€™t knock, it kicks the door in. This mixed genre collection of micro-fiction, short stories, and prose poems peers into the gray area between where a dream ends and reality begins. Characters trespass into dangerous emotional and physical worlds, confronting loss, class divides, and the quiet collapse of moral certainty. As the world unravels around them, one question echoes: When the rules of society fall apart, what remains of humanity? In emotionally evocative bursts of narrative and lyrical reflection, the collection explores how we endure what the world offers and what it takes away.
